# Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator 

## Description
In this challenge I created an professional README Generator using [Node.js](https://badges.aleen42.com/src/node.svg) and the terminal. The README Generator must include a title of the project, descriptions, table of contents, installations, usage, license, contributing, tests and questions sections. It must also include the license badge and a link to it. 

Other than the minimum requirements, I also added color styling in my terminal so that user are able to differentiate the questions and command line. 

I was able to successfully create a professional README Generator.
